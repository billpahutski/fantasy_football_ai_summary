Using NFL game and player data, plus LLMs to summarize games and highlight key play statistics each week

My mom and I are in an annual 1-on-1 fantasy football league, in which we draft teams, instead of players. The goal is to get the most wins from all of your teams, plus bonus points for playoff appearances and wins. 

In 2024, I decided I wanted to do weekly write-ups about the games each week, but finding the time to do that was hard. So I created this script to load in weekly NFL game and player data, organize it, format it, have an LLM summarize it, and then send it all in an email to my distribution list (comprised of mainly friends and family). 

It's definitely not perfect, as the headers for each game often repeat terms ("Gridiron Gauntlet", etc) but overall, it works really well for a low-impact weekly summarizer for friends and family.


Enjoy!
